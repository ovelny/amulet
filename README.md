## Convention rules

This repo is meant to be roughly organized like [PayloadsAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings): each category has its own directory and shouldn't have more than one level of nesting â€” in most cases, just a `README.md` file with the addition of scripts and examples.

Categories follow the kekab case naming convention, all lowercase acronyms included.

PRs are welcome! I'm still learning and contributions are appreciated.
